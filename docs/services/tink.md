# Tink

Tink provides the user interface and the API gateway to expose all the features distributed across the various other Tinkerbell services. It lives in the GitHub repository: [tinkerbell/tink](https://github.com/tinkerbell/tink).

It exposes three binaries:

1. The `tink-server` is a long running daemon written in Go that exposes a gRPC API. As a user and operator this is your entry point. You can register new hardware, create templates and workflows, and much more.
2. The `tink-cli` is one of the ways you can interact with `tink-server`. It is a command line interface written in Go and [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra).
3. The `tink-worker` is a binary that runs on every worker machine. It is one of the first processes started by a worker and it executes workflows.

## Getting Tink

Right now we do not yet have a release cycle in place that builds and releases binaries. You can either compile them yourself or you can use the Docker containers that are already built.

The docker containers are the ones in use when you follow the setup tutorial and run [`docker-compose`](https://github.com/tinkerbell/tink/blob/master/deploy/docker-compose.yml#L4).

### Getting the Docker Images

We rely on Docker for both code distribution and workflow execution. Our CI/CD pipeline builds and pushes images to [quay.io](https://quay.io/tinkerbell), a popular image repository similar to Docker Hub.

There's a repository for each tool:

- [tink-cli](https://quay.io/repository/tinkerbell/tink-cli?tab=tags)
- [tink-worker](https://quay.io/repository/tinkerbell/tink-worker?tab=tags)
- [tink-server](https://quay.io/repository/tinkerbell/tink?tab=tags)

The tags are composed as: `sha-<gitsha>`, where `gitsha` is the first 7 characters of a git commit. Only master commits are pushed to quay.io.

### Building the Binaries

Tinkerbell uses the standard Golang toolchain. You can clone the tink repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:tinkerbell/tink
```

All the binaries are inside `cmd/tink-*`. Based on what you need, you can run `go build`. For example if you would like to compile the CLI, run:

```
go build cmd/tink-cli/main.go
```

You can also use `go run` if you want to run code without needing to compile a binary:

```
go run cmd/tink-server/main.go
```

## Building and Running `tink-cli`

One use case of the binaries is when you want to run the `tink-cli` binary on the Provisioner, outside the `tink-server` container. This simplifies CLI command usage.

Prerequisites:

- A bit of familiarity with `go build`, and Go has to be installed.
- A Provisioner up and running Tinkerbell (works with the Vagrant setup, for example)

SSH into the Provisioner and Navigate to the directory where you have cloned the tink repository.

```
ssh
cd tink
```

Now let's compile the binary with:

```
$ go build -o tink cmd/tink-cli/main.go
```

All the traffic between Tinkerbell services is encrypted via TLS, so before running any `tink` commands there are two environment variables that authenticate the CLI to the `tink-server`. The `tink-server` entry point is 127.0.0.1 and is exposed on ports 42113 and 42114.

- `TINKERBELL_CERT_URL=http://127.0.0.1:42114/cert`
- `TINKERBELL_GRPC_AUTHORITY=127.0.0.1:42113`

NOTE: In a real environment, every person that has access to the host and ports can authenticate and use `tink-server`.

You can export them as environment variables or you can run them in-line as part of the `tink` command.

```
$ export TINKERBELL_GRPC_AUTHORITY=127.0.0.1:42113
$ export TINKERBELL_CERT_URL=http://127.0.0.1:42114/cert
```

Now you can run `tink` commands without `docker-exec`.

```
$ tink hardware list
>
+----+-------------+------------+----------+
| ID | MAC ADDRESS | IP ADDRESS | HOSTNAME |
+----+-------------+------------+----------+
+----+-------------+------------+----------+
```

You can also test by making some hardware data.

```
$ cat > hardware-data.json <<EOF
